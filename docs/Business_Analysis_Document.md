## 1. Executive Summary

The Environmental Compliance Management System (ECMS) aims to address the need for efficient and effective environmental compliance management. This system will streamline processes, ensure regulatory compliance, and improve data accuracy through the development of a Progressive Web Application (PWA). The PWA will feature real-time monitoring and alerts, geospatial data visualization, comprehensive reporting, and a user-friendly interface. The key benefits include improved compliance tracking, enhanced data accuracy, streamlined processes, better decision-making through data insights, and increased operational efficiency.
